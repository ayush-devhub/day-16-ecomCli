# E-Commerce CLI (SKIPPED)

A CLI-based simulation of an e-commerce backend system.  
This project is the **Core Java Capstone**, preparing for Spring Boot.

## Day 1 â€“ Setup & Models

- Defined entities: User, Product, Cart, Order.
- Introduced enums: OrderStatus, UserRole.
- Scaffolded FileService for CSV persistence.

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- File I/O (CSV)
- OOP + Enums + Generics (to be added Day 2)

## Next Steps

- Implement business logic services (Day 2).
- Add CLI controller to simulate REST (Day 3).
